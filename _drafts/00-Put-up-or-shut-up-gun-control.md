Too many people dead
===============

There are too many people dead from guns in the USA. Something needs
to change. However, there are vastly different and irreconcilable
ideas about how to change. Each party says that their plan will reduce
gun deathsand that the other party's plan will bring the
apocalypse. No one can enact their plan beause it is opposed by the
other party.

Put up or shut up
=================

Since we cannot agree which plan to follow, let's follow both and see
which one works better and then follow that. If someone can't agree to
this, it casts doubt as to whether they believe their plan would be
better. So agree to test your ideas or concede that you don't believe
your idea will work. Put-up or shut-up.

A sketch of how this would work
------------

Pass a constitutional ammendment:

In order to reduce the alarming number of deaths by firearms, and the
accompanying terror: in 2018, the two largest parties in congress
shall create two objective measures of success. In November there shall be a special referrendum at which plans each may reword
or repeal the 2nd ammendment. They shall also create two objective
criteria for success.
