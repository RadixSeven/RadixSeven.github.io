This is a very unfocused blog about my many interests: ethics,
science, computer programming, distributed systems, artificial
intelligence, machine learning, science fiction, United States
politics.

Legal stuff
============

As of this writing, I am an employee of a contractor employed by the
United State federal government. So my free speech rights are
restricted: I am forbidden by law to lobby concerning upcoming
contracts my employer might participate in. It is my intention to
comply with this law. Please notify me by email if I have made a
mistake and I will either take down the problematic post or modify it
with a note about why I think it is OK for me to post.

I also do not speak for either my employer or the government agency
(NCBI) where I spend almost all my working hours. This blog represents
my own opinions only.
